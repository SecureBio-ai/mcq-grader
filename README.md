# mcq-grader
Grade the performance of LLMs on multiple choice exams. Currently only OpenAI models are supported.

## Setup
1. To install dependencies run `pip install requirements.txt`. I'm running Python 3.9.18.  
2. Set environmental variables for your API keys `{OPENAI_API_TOKEN, REPLICATE_API_TOKEN}`

## Running mcq-grader
To grade exam/s run 
```
./run.py --input samplesheet.csv
``` 
The samplesheet is a csv file that specifies one or multiple "runs." Each run should have a unique name and can specify
different exams (as .tsv files), prompts, models, and model-params.  
  
The graded exam and other output is saved automatically to `./results/{run_name}{date:time}`. 

## Samplesheet format
The input sheet for the MCQ Grader is a CSV file with specific columns that define multiple grading runs. Each row in 
the input sheet represents a separate grading task. The required format for the input CSV is as follows:
* `name`: a unique identifier for the run.
* `input`: path to a .tsv input file containing the MCQs to be graded (see "Exam format").
* `prompt`: path to the JSON file containing the grading prompt (see "Prompts"). 
* `model`: identifier for the model to be used, e.g., 'gpt-4'. A full list of model names is in `model_utils.py` although some may not be supported yet.
* `model-params`: optional. A dictionary of model parameters to customize the grading behavior. Leave blank to use default settings.

An example input sheet

| name                     | input | prompt | model | model-params |
|--------------------------| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| gpt4-mmlu-virology       | ./data/mmlu/virology.tsv | ./grading-prompts/mmlu-gpt.json | gpt-4 | {temperature: 0.9} |
| llama2-70b-mmlu-virology | ./data/mmlu/virology.tsv | ./grading-prompts/mmlu-llama.json | llama2_70b | |

## Exam format
The exam should be a .tsv file with at least four columns: `{question, A, B, answer}`. The exam can have A-Z option 
columns. If your exam has different kinds of multiple-choice questions (e.g., True/False, a question with six options) 
simply leave the option columns you don't need blank.    

You may include other columns (with different names) after the question, choices, and answer columns â€“ these 
will be ignored by mcq-grader.

Mcq-grader will parse the exam to check for logical inconsistencies like "Correct answer given as C but only options A 
and B have text in them."
